# mass_size

In this repository, I have included a script that allows Chebyshev polynomials to be interpolated. 
The tools developed as part of the MegaMorph (Measuring Galaxy Morphology) project (Häußler et al. 2013; Vika et al. 2013) allow robust size measurements  characterisation of morphological properties to be reliably established. Because these tools use and model data at all available wavelengths simultaneously, the galaxy model parameters are fit with wavelength-dependent functions – namely Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind (Abramowitz & Stegun 1965). The code, get_Cheb_poly.py allows users to interpolate the polynomials from the Galapagos catalogs so that any of the galaxy parameters maybe be obtained at any wavelength. For instance, if one wished to obtain the rest-frame 5000Å size

Please see Nedkova K. V., et al., 2021, MNRAS, 506, 928 for more details and please cite this paper when using this code.
